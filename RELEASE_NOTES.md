# LazyQoder v1.3.0 — adaptive workflow experience

This release prepares the v1.3.0 package. It does not publish a tag,
marketplace entry, or host installation. Package readiness and current host
observation remain separate authorities.

This is a feature release. It adds dual activation, progressive milestones
with scoped decision gates, human plan-edit reconciliation, a cross-plan
decision ledger, and verification-tier selection with receipt reuse. Qoder
CLI, Qoder IDE, and qoder-app route boundaries are unchanged: package
selection never proves host activation, and host readiness stays explicit
pending without fresh-session evidence.

## Eval-driven fixes

- Explicit start-work and plain natural-language implementation requests
  converge on the same execution authority and gates. Explanation,
  quoted-command, and explicit plan-only requests never mutate product files,
  and an ambiguous approval with several pending questions never grants
  execution authority.
- `execution_intent` (plan_only|execute) is persisted separately from workflow
  mode and current stage, defaulting to plan_only. Duplicate host events do
  not duplicate dispatch; resume selects the single compatible run or asks
  only when genuinely ambiguous.
- Complex work uses one parent plan with milestones. Provisional milestones
  never dispatch; dependency cycles, missing IDs, and dangling child links are
  rejected. Decision gates carry the canonical shape; a recommendation never
  becomes owner approval and only transitive dependents block.
- Human plan edits are reconciled at execution boundaries: cosmetic edits
  preserve all evidence, semantic edits invalidate only the affected task and
  its transitive dependents, a human checked box is a completion assertion
  never a verified result, and stale results cannot update newer plan state.
- Cross-plan decision memory is durable (`decisions/ledger.jsonl`): immutable
  versioned events, replay-derived active view, scoped corrections, and
  visible failure on malformed records.
- Verification is selected once from the changed boundary and risk on the
  V0-V3 tier ladder, then a green receipt is reused while its declared inputs
  and covered behavior are unchanged. Counts never promote a tier; a failing
  focused check reruns only itself plus directly affected integration checks.

## Measured efficiency

This patch does not change the compact task packet or any previously measured
byte, assertion, or gate figure. The previously recorded baseline measured
the compact task packet at 1,637 bytes rather than 2,285 bytes, a
648-byte / **28.36%** reduction, with the direct and six-module quality gates
unchanged at 13/13 and 57/57 assertions. No new efficiency claim is made here.

## Host capability matrix

| Host | Package route | Readiness requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Qoder CLI | Release-root local marketplace | Fresh session with one loaded Skill or command and all six MCP connections. |
| Qoder CLI | CLI-backed marketplace when available; observed-build GUI or recovery fallback otherwise | Fresh IDE session with the same loaded surface and six live MCP connections. |
| Qoder IDE | `.qoder-plugin/plugin.json` through the host's visible marketplace/plugin flow | Current-build receipt for a Skill, command, agent, hook, and all six MCP connections. |

Package checks are package evidence only. Every host remains **pending host
proof** until it is observed in a fresh session; this release does not claim
that any host loaded, enabled, or connected anything.

## Migration and upgrade

Use the durable launcher to update from v1.2.3 after inventorying
receipt-owned, modified, and unknown assets. Preserve user changes and
host-managed settings. Run package checks, then start a fresh host session and
observe the selected route before reporting host readiness. Existing
valid declarations, including executable paths containing spaces, need no change.

## Known risks

- Live marketplace discovery, plugin loading, hooks, workflow dispatch, and
  MCP connectivity remain host-owned and pending without current-session
  evidence.
- The command validation is a local declaration boundary. It does not prove
  that a declared server starts, that its arguments are safe, or that a host
  will load it.
- Host tool surfaces may interpose their own command shims. A shim that does
  not implement POSIX extended regular-expression classes can change the
  behavior of shipped shell checks on that host; this release converts the
  affected hook patterns to POSIX character classes but cannot constrain
  arbitrary host shims.
- Same-version ref movement, a changed runtime/executable, or changed host
  fingerprint invalidates prior evidence and requires re-verification.

## Rollback

Stop the host session and run durable `offboard` plan-first. After approval,
remove only unmodified v1.3.0 receipt-owned assets, preserve modified, unknown,
linked, caller-owned, and host-managed state, then reactivate the intended
immutable prior release. Start a fresh session and re-observe the selected host
route; never edit receipts, `active.json`, or private host registries by hand.
