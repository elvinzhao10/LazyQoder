# LazyQoder

![LazyQoder](lazyqoder-banner.jpg)

LazyQoder helps you use structured, evidence-based workflows in **Qoder CLI
CLI**, **Qoder CLI IDE**, and **Qoder IDE**. It prepares local package assets
and guidance; a host is only considered ready after it is observed in a fresh
session.

The current release package is v1.2.2. It is prepared for publication; package
checks do not by themselves publish a tag or prove a host loaded it.

## v1.2.2 adaptive context

- Automatic selection chooses the smallest sufficient existing workflow from
  task risk and complexity; it is selection-only until host readiness is
  observed, so it never claims a workflow was loaded or dispatched by a host.
- Current compact task packets are 1,637 bytes versus 2,285 bytes before the
  change: a 648-byte, **28.36%** reduction. Required safety, approval,
  evidence, review, and completion gates are unchanged; the release quality
  assertions remain unchanged.
- Orchestrated execution sends a compact identity, delta, artifact-reference,
  and validated-command packet instead of repeating the whole plan. It records
  read-only pre-task provenance; runtime work needs a real entry artifact and
  stateful work also needs a before/after transition. Lost results are accepted
  only when their identity and artifacts still match, while unaffected review
  lanes are retained. An interrupted pre-state run rolls back its own temporary
  transaction material and can be retried without changing caller files.

## Efficiency improvements in v1.2.0

- Verification is selected by deterministic risk: focused checks cover small,
  low-risk work, while release, security, stale-evidence, and public-contract
  changes always run the comprehensive gate.
- The verifier reports shell, Node, and Python results separately, uses
  bounded Node concurrency, and keeps classification-sensitive shell checks
  serial for reliable outcomes.
- Redacted cost/outcome records make invocations, reruns, rework, concurrency,
  and evidence volume visible without estimating unavailable token data.

## Recommended: install with AI help

You do not need to manually work through every setup detail. Open an AI coding
assistant in your project and paste this:

> Help me install LazyQoder from https://github.com/elvinzhao10/LazyQoder for
> this project. Use the v1.2.2 route. Run safe package checks first,
> explain each step plainly, and ask me before changing marketplace, plugin,
> Skills, MCP, account, credential, or trust settings.

The assistant can guide onboarding, but you approve every host-managed change.

## Manual setup

Manual setup is available when you prefer complete control. You need
**Node.js LTS 20 or newer** and **Git**. Start from the verified origin
`https://github.com/elvinzhao10/LazyQoder` and follow the
[installation guide](docs/03-install-and-host-verification.md).

Run `onboard` once to create a durable installation. After that, use the stable
launcher for `update`, `status`, and safe `offboard`:

```text
node "<install-root>/LazyQoder/launcher.js" status
```

## What “ready” means

- **Package readiness** means the copied package and local checks are valid.
- **Host readiness** needs a fresh host session, one real Skill or command,
  and every expected MCP connection.

Until that is observed, the honest result is **HOST READINESS: PENDING**.
Local files and load checks never prove that a host loaded the plugin.

The default package doctor does not discover or execute `qodercli` from
`PATH`. Optional host-manifest validation is an explicit action using
`bash scripts/lazyqoder-plugin-doctor.sh --host-validator /absolute/path`.
The release verifier runs classified shell regressions serially, all package
`tests/*.test.js` with conservative Node concurrency, and Python tests under
`tests/` and `tooling/`; its JSON names those outcomes separately.

## Choose one route

Pick one host route during onboarding:

- **Qoder CLI CLI** uses the documented local marketplace route.
- **Qoder CLI IDE** uses that marketplace route when the CLI is available.
- **Qoder IDE** uses its full-plugin marketplace route.

Skills plus manual MCP connectors are a recovery-only option. Do not run that
fallback beside a full-plugin route for the same project. Stop the session,
remove only LazyQoder's previous entries through the host UI, choose one route,
and start a new session to verify it.

## Design mindset

Start with the result you want and how you will know it worked. Then use the
smallest amount of structure that fits the task. You can simply describe the
work in plain language; the modes are guidance, not commands you need to
memorize.

| Mode | Use it when | Example request |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct | The change is small and clear. | “Fix this error and run the relevant test.” |
| Assisted | You need help understanding an unfamiliar area or failure. | “Help me find why this command fails, then verify the fix.” |
| Planned | The work has several parts or important choices. | “Make a plan for this feature before changing files.” |
| Orchestrated | The work affects a release, security, or a risky change. | “Review this release and prepare it for publication.” |
| Long-horizon | The goal needs to continue across sessions. | “Keep working on this migration with checkpoints.” |

## Keep host changes deliberate

LazyQoder does not automate credentials, OAuth values, private registries, or
trust settings. It asks for approval before any host-managed action and keeps
safe package checks separate from marketplace and connector changes.

## Package inventory

| Surface | Count | Role |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Skills | 14 | Host-facing workflow policies for planning, execution, review, and verification. |
| Commands | 14 | Named host entry points for those workflow policies. |
| Agents | 13 | Specialist role definitions for planning, implementation, QA, security, and context. |
| MCP declarations | 6 | Local services for ledger, verification, status, context, code intelligence, and docs. |

## Technical reference and evaluation

The source-level explanation lives in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). It
maps the package structure, request flow, state model, security boundaries,
MCP lifecycle, and release checks with diagrams tied to the implementation.

For a capability-by-capability comparison with the original LazyCodex design,
including what LazyQoder implements and where it intentionally differs, see
[lazyqoder-evaluation.md](lazyqoder-evaluation.md).

LazyQoder is primarily inspired by LazyCodex
([upstream project](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/lazycodex)). Its
relationship to OmO and upstream sources is recorded in [NOTICE](NOTICE).
It is an independent implementation and does not require LazyCodex or OmO at
runtime.
