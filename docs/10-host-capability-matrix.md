# Host capability matrix

LazyQoder deliberately aligns policy and package safety across hosts while keeping host adapters distinct. The same package may be present on two surfaces without both hosts exposing the same loading or registration behavior.

## Onboarding baseline

## Current v1.3.0 evidence boundary

This documentation release covers `qodercli-cli`, `qodercli-ide`, and
`qoder`; it does not publish a v1.3.0 package or claim a host has loaded
one. Marketplace is the default full-plugin route for Qoder CLI and
the Qoder app. The Skills/manual-MCP route is recovery-only and mutually exclusive
with a full-plugin route in the same project.

| v2 field | Allowed values and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Native mode | `invoke-documented`, `observe-only`, `descriptor-only`, or `unavailable`. |
| Public label | `documented-tested`, `documented-untested`, `observed-build-specific`, or `unavailable`. |
| Evidence scope | `package`, `probe`, or `current-session`; `package` does not prove a live host. |

Require **Node.js LTS 20 or newer** and **Git**. Bootstrap `onboard` only from
`https://github.com/elvinzhao10/LazyQoder.git`; then run `update`, `status`,
and plan-first `offboard` with
`node "<install-root>/LazyQoder/launcher.js"`. The durable tree is
`LazyQoder/{active.json,launcher.js,releases/,receipts/,rollback/,staging/,locks/}`
and survives source deletion. Moving a same-version ref requires full-SHA
confirmation; stale runtime recovery is scoped offboard/re-onboard. None of
this proves a host: **HOST READINESS: PENDING** until observation.

Automatic selection chooses the smallest sufficient existing workflow from task
risk and complexity. It remains selection-only until host readiness is observed;
selection never proves native workflow loading or host dispatch.

Open or link the durable release selected by `status` in the selected host, give the agent
`https://github.com/elvinzhao10/LazyQoder`, and type `onboard`. The agent
detects or asks for Qoder CLI, Qoder IDE, or the Qoder app, runs safe
package checks, and reports package readiness separately from host readiness.
Before a host-managed change it asks for approval, gives one exact action, and
waits. It then uses Computer Use or a user-pasted status/screenshot; reload or
new session is a later action. Verify one real Skill/command and all six MCP
connections. Without observation, **HOST READINESS: PENDING**.

Route status is explicit: the local marketplace is the **documented Qoder CLI
CLI route and the preferred Qoder CLI route whenever the Qoder CLI is
available**. The Qoder app uses `.qoder-plugin/plugin.json` as its default
marketplace full-plugin route. The `manual-skills-mcp-fallback` is recovery
only.

## What each host needs

| Host | Local route | Supported fallback | Required host proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Qoder IDE** | When the CLI is available (`qodercli`), use the user-scope release-root marketplace route shared with Qoder CLI. The GUI route is only an observed-build alternative; the supplied GUI Add local directory flow failed. | Public Skills import plus manual MCP JSON when the CLI is unavailable. It excludes commands, agents, and hooks. | New-session Skill/command appropriate to the chosen route and all six MCP connections. |
| **Qoder CLI** | Run durable `status --route qodercli-marketplace`, then use its active durable release root with `qodercli plugin marketplace add "<active-durable-release-root>"`; wait before `qodercli plugin install lazyqoder@lazyqoder`. | Inside a Qoder CLI session, the interactive `/plugin` menu provides the same route. `--plugin-dir` is development/testing only, never persistent. | Fresh-session Skill/command and all six MCP connections. |
| **Qoder app** | The active release's `.qoder-plugin/plugin.json` marketplace source, declaring Skills, commands, agents, hooks, and six MCP servers. | Recovery-only Skills import plus six manual local MCP connectors. It excludes commands, agents, and hooks. | A current source/version/build/session receipt with one loaded Skill, command, agent, hook, and all six MCP connections. |

The supplied macOS QA dated 2026-07-18 inspected the Qoder app v5.2.6 on macOS
with a historical LazyQoder package; the Qoder CLI exact host version/build was not recorded.
For Qoder CLI,
prefer the CLI marketplace route whenever available; the GUI local-directory
marketplace is only a fallback observed-build alternative. In Qoder IDE, use
only the marketplace/plugin action exposed by the current build and never
inspect or mutate private registries. Missing public schema documentation does
not demote the manifest route. Fully restart and
verify a fresh session as later actions. If the required control is unavailable, record the exact
limitation and retain **HOST READINESS: PENDING**. The fallback's absolute
six-launcher JSON and explicit project context are in [Host routes](reference/host-routes.md#manual-connector-specification).

Before requesting that host mutation, run this read-only preflight from the
release root:

```bash
bash lazyqoder-plugin/scripts/lazyqoder-qoder-preparation-check.sh \
  --project-dir "<absolute-project-root>"
```

It prints `HOST_PREPARATION=not-applied`, `HOST_MUTATION=none`, and
`HOST_READINESS=pending`; `--apply` refuses. It is not an installer and never
proves host readiness.

For the Qoder IDE GUI alternative, wait for marketplace discovery, install
as a separate action, then fully restart before inspecting a fresh session.

`.qodercli/settings.json` is shareable non-secret project scope.
`.qodercli/settings.local.json` is ignored local/machine scope and remains
unstaged; secrets must never be committed. Package checks preserve both.

## Structural differences

The host adapter differs, but the safety model does not:

- **Host integration:** Qoder CLI, Qoder IDE, and the Qoder app decide plugin discovery, connector registration, session lifetime, and event delivery.
- **State/path:** package run state and receipt-owned tooling roots are local; marketplace directories, `.qoder` data, credentials, and connector state remain host/user-owned.
- **Inventory:** six local MCP servers are packaged. Optional remote exports and browser work remain separate explicit decisions.

## Package-built versus host-native behavior

| Behavior | LazyQoder contribution | Raw host contribution | Learner takeaway |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow guidance | Ships skills, commands, and agent role text. | Decides whether/how those assets are discovered and exposed. | A Markdown command definition is not a running command. |
| Hook policy | Ships event mapping and scripts that validate supported input. | Delivers an event and decides the host lifecycle semantics. | A passing hook test does not prove a host delivered the event. |
| Local MCP | Ships six launchers and server programs. | Starts the process, negotiates connection, and shows tool availability. | A declaration is not a connection. |
| Run/evidence state | Implements package-local scripts and boundaries. | Supplies session context and user-visible integration. | Local records describe package work, not host state. |
| Optional providers | Implements policy, receipts, and export fragments. | Stores credentials and applies connector/network policy. | Selection/receipt status is not provider authorization or connection. |

The complete dependency classification is in [Dependency and host boundary reference](reference/dependency-and-host-boundaries.md).

## Readiness and fallback claims

The package contract uses four explicit evidence scopes: `package-ready`,
`observed-build-route`, `manual-skills-mcp-fallback`, and `live-host-proof`.
Load-check, doctor, and capability reports emit only `package-ready`; they do
not claim that a host loaded a plugin or connected an MCP process. A route seen
in one build is an `observed-build-route`, not universal host support.

The Qoder app fallback is Skills plus six manually configured local MCP
connectors. It explicitly excludes agents, commands, and hooks. It must not be
run alongside a full plugin route for the same project: coexistence is
unsupported and may duplicate Skills or MCP processes. Stop the session,
remove only the old LazyQoder entries in the host UI, choose one route, restart,
and verify that route before making a live-host-proof claim.

## macOS-only scope

The package evidence is verified on macOS only. It does not claim equivalent host loading, marketplace behavior, hook execution, or MCP connection on other operating systems. Those are observed per host session.

## Migration and removal

To change routes, stop the active session, remove only LazyQoder's
receipt-scoped plugin/Skills entry and connectors that the user added through
the host UI, choose one route, and verify it in a fresh session. Preserve
other plugins, connectors, credentials, project settings, and host-managed
paths. Package removal remains separate from observed host removal.
