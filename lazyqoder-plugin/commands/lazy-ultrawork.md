# /lazyqoder:lazy-ultrawork

Activates binding ultrawork mode: tier triage classifies the work as LIGHT or HEAVY, then the PIN→RED→GREEN→SURFACE→CLEAN loop executes with evidence capture at every step. A binding reviewer gate (HEAVY only) requires unconditional approval before completion.

## Qoder IDE mapping

LazyQoder's binding review gate maps to **Qoder IDE Expert teams** (领域专家智能体: frontend/backend/db/ops/test). The `lazy-ultrawork` HEAVY-tier binding reviewer is realized by an isolated Qoder IDE expert agent; durable execution uses **Qoder IDE Agent mode + Subagents** (long-running Agent mode + Subagents (Qoder IDE cites end-to-end delivery on multi-hour, whole-repo tasks such as a 26-hour refactor; Repowiki/Quest/Subagent usage is unlimited)).

## Usage

```
/lazyqoder:lazy-ultrawork "task description"
```

## Inputs

- Task description (natural language)
- Workspace context via `qoder.md`
- Existing tests, lint, and build scripts (discovered by the skill)

## Outputs

- Implemented change (production code + tests)
- `.lazyqoder/runs/<run_id>/evidence/` — real-surface proof artifacts
- Binding reviewer verdict (APPROVE / REJECT) for HEAVY-tier work
- Cleanup receipts for all QA resources

## Success Criteria

1. Tier correctly classified (LIGHT or HEAVY) with supporting facts
2. PIN step captured existing behavior before changes
3. RED step produced a failing-first proof
4. GREEN step made the proof pass with minimal production code
5. SURFACE step captured a real-surface artifact (not `--dry-run`)
6. CLEAN step tore down all QA resources with receipts
7. For HEAVY: binding reviewer returned unconditional APPROVE
8. All success standards met before claiming done

## Constitution

This command is governed by its package-local skill contract below.

Do not claim completion without verification.
