# /lazyqoder:lazy-ulw-plan

Create a decision-complete work plan. The planner explores the codebase, researches unknowns, evaluates alternatives, and writes a structured plan. Never writes product code — planning only.

## Qoder IDE mapping

LazyQoder's decision-complete planning primitive maps to **Qoder IDE Quest mode** (auto tech-design/spec). The `lazy-ulw-plan` skill produces an explicit, human-reviewable plan document that mirrors the structured spec Quest mode generates.

## Usage

```
/lazyqoder:lazy-ulw-plan "what to build"
```

## Inputs

- User's build request (natural language description)
- Workspace context (`qoder.md`, project structure, existing plans)
- Codebase state (via explorer subagents)

## Outputs

- Plan file written to `.lazyqoder/plans/<slug>.md`
- Decision log with alternatives considered and rationale
- Task decomposition with dependency graph

## Success Criteria

1. Plan file written and self-contained
2. Every decision has a documented rationale
3. Task decomposition is granular and dependency-ordered
4. Approval gate presented (awaits user "approved" or `/lazyqoder:lazy-start-work`)

## Constitution

This command is governed by its package-local skill contract below.
